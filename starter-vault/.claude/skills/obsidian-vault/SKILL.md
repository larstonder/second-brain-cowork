description: Save notes, learnings, decisions, meeting notes, people profiles, project docs, brag entries, how-to guides, and any other knowledge to the user's Obsidian vault. Use when the user says "save this to my vault", "make a note about", "add to obsidian", "remember this", "log this decision", "create a vault note", "save this learning", "add a brag", or wants to persist any piece of context, knowledge, or reference for future retrieval. Also use when asked to look up, search, or retrieve information from the vault.

# Obsidian Vault Skill

Save and retrieve knowledge from the user's Obsidian vault.

## Vault Path

**All operations target the vault folder this Cowork project has access to**, the `starter-vault/` folder the participant pointed the project at during setup. Read and write notes there. The folders below (`Notes/`, `Learning/`, ...) live at the root of that vault folder.

If you cannot see the vault files, the project does not have access to the folder yet. Tell the participant to point this Cowork project at the `starter-vault/` folder (see `docs/02-bootstrap-obsidian.md`) rather than guessing a path.

## Quick Reference: Where to Put Things

| Content | Type | Folder | Template |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| Atomic idea, concept, snippet | `note` | `Notes/` | Note |
| Book/article/video summary | `learning` | `Learning/` | Learning |
| Decision with options/rationale | `decision` | `Notes/` | Decision |
| Meeting notes | `meeting` | `Meetings/` | Meeting |
| Person profile | `person` | `Personal/People/` | Person |
| Project documentation | `project` | `Projects/` | Project |
| Work achievement / win | `brag` | `Notes/` | Brag |
| How-to / SOP for yourself | `how-to-guide` | `Reference/` | How-To Guide |
| Reference material | `resource` | `Reference/` | Note |
| Daily note | `daily` | `Personal/` | — |

## Before Creating Any Note

**SEARCH FIRST** — the vault's value is in connections, not isolated notes.

1. `grep` the vault for keywords from the topic (search the current directory with `--glob '*.md'`)
2. `find` files by name pattern to check if a note already exists
3. Search synonyms and related terms
4. If a note exists, **update it** instead of creating a duplicate

## Frontmatter (REQUIRED on every note)

```yaml
---
type: <type>
created: DD.MM.YYYY
tags: []
related: []
---
```

### All Valid Types

`note` · `project` · `meeting` · `daily` · `resource` · `person` · `decision` · `learning` · `how-to-guide` · `brag`

### Type-Specific Extra Fields

| Type | Extra Fields |
|------|-------------|
| `project` | `status: planning\|active\|on-hold\|completed\|archived`, `due: YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `meeting` | `date: DD.MM.YYYY`, `attendees: []` |
| `person` | `last_contact: DD.MM.YYYY` |
| `decision` | `status: active`, `revisit: YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `learning` | `source:`, `author:`, `status: draft\|active\|completed` |
| `how-to-guide` | `last_updated: DD.MM.YYYY` |
| `brag` | `date: DD.MM.YYYY` |

### Tag Conventions

Hierarchical tags for cross-cutting concerns:
- `#status/todo`, `#status/in-progress`, `#status/done`, `#status/waiting`
- `#source/book`, `#source/article`, `#source/video`, `#source/podcast`
- `#area/work`, `#area/health`, `#area/finance`

## File Naming

- General: `Human Readable Name.md` (title case with spaces)
- Meetings: `YYYY-MM-DD Meeting Topic.md`
- Daily: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Linking Rules

- **ALWAYS** use `[[wiki links]]` for internal references, never markdown links
- **Link when the connection is real.** A note with substantial content and 1 honest link beats a note with thin content and 7 invented links. Do not add links to hit a count.
- **Search before concluding a note is isolated.** If a draft has 0 links, search the vault again for synonyms and related names. If nothing relevant exists, leave the note unlinked — that is not a failure.
- `related:` in frontmatter is **optional**. Use it only for relationships the body does not already express via inline `[[wikilinks]]`. Do not duplicate.
- **Backlinks only when reciprocal.** Update an older note to link back only if the reverse link is also meaningful.

### Ghost-link discipline (CRITICAL)

A ghost-link is a `[[wikilink]]` pointing to a file that does not exist yet. Ghost-links themselves are fine — Obsidian tracks them in Unresolved Links and they act as forcing functions.

What is **not** fine: writing a paraphrased gloss next to a ghost-link that makes a factual claim the source cannot back. Example of the failure mode: writing `- [[Pilot to Production]] — why 75% of AI pilots don't scale` when the source actually said "25% moved 40%+ into production." The inverted number is an agent interpretation that now lives in the vault as if it were fact.

Acceptable patterns:
1. **Bare ghost-link:** `[[Pilot to Production]]` with no gloss.
2. **Stub with direct source quote:** create the target file with 1-2 lines quoting or citing the source, attributed.

Never write an agent-authored paraphrase next to a ghost-link whose target file is empty. That is how hallucinations enter the vault disguised as linked knowledge.

## Date Format

- Display/frontmatter: `DD.MM.YYYY` (e.g., `04.04.2026`)
- Filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD` (for sorting)

## Hard Rules

- NEVER create notes without frontmatter
- NEVER use markdown-style `[text](link)` for internal links
- NEVER manually edit anything in the vault's `.obsidian/` directory (that is Obsidian's own state)
- ALWAYS search before creating
- ALWAYS add wiki links and related notes
- ALWAYS use absolute paths when writing outside the CWD (resolve the vault root from `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` or `SETUP.md`)
